# Python Uno
It's a simple uno card game in Python. It's nothing special. Heck, as of writing this its nothing more than a virtual deck shuffler.

## update 1 (12/4)
you can now win against yourself. there are no bots yet and REVERSE, DRAW 2, and SKIP cards do nothing yet. WILDCARDS, however, do work.

## update 2 (12/5)
You can now play against 2 to 5 bots. That's all the customizability right now. You can also play the game and they can now win against you. DRAW 2/4, and SKIP still dont do anything, WILDCARDS still work, but are broken for the bots, and REVERSE cards *should* work, but I think they are still broken on the bots. Reverse code also inst that great. The end.
